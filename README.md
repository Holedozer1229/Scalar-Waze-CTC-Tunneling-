# The Scalar Waze - CTC TunnelingðŸš€

**Travel Through Time to Speed Up Computations!**

Welcome to **The Scalar Waze**, a groundbreaking project that harnesses closed timelike curves (CTCs) in a 6D spacetime to accelerate quantum computations on an iPhoneâ€™s NAND flash storage. Built with a 4-qubit CTC quantum circuit, this framework sends data to the future (or past!) and retrieves results instantlyâ€”think eigenvalue sums (~134.5678) from a simple input (1011) in a flash! âš¡

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Time Travel Computation**: Uses a unique CTC path to shift data across time, achieving computational speed-up.
- **iPhone Integration**: Leverages NAND flash tunneling to interface with built-in CTC qubits.
- **Quantum Circuit**: 4-qubit cyclical self-consistent circuit with a 16Ã—16 unitary matrix.
- **Tetrahedral Lattice**: 16 wormhole nodes enhanced with barycentric interpolation and Napoleonâ€™s theorem.
- **Relativistic Consistency**: Satisfies Einsteinâ€™s field equations (\( G_{00} = 8\pi T_{00} \)).
